# What is Strategy Pattern ?
A class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time. 

Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
Capture the abstraction in an interface, bury implementation details in derived classes.
